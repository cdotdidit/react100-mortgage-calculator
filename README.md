react100 mortgage calculator
Instructions: Mortgage Calculator
Introduction
In this project we're going to: - Create a simple mortgage payment calculator app using React - Style the app using the Bootstrap framework

For this you will need to build a web form that accepts the loan balance, interest rate, loan term in years (either 15 or 30 years) and a calculate button. Below you will find the algorithm you will need to implement to figure out the payment when the calculate button is clicked. When complete, your app should closely resemble the screenshot below the algorithm.

Setup
Open a terminal
Clone your starter files from Github and open the project in VS code.
Run: npm install to install all the dependencies.
As you add code to the project, you will want to view your progress in a browser. To do this, first type npm run build to compile your project. Then, type npm start to launch your project on a local webserver. In your console window, you should see the output Server is listening on port 3000. Open a browser to the url, http://localhost:3000/ to render the project and view your progress.
The tests will confirm if you have completed the requirements. Type npm test and hit enter to run the tests. Then, write your code using the steps below. When you have written all the code to complete the project (based on the exit criteria) and the tests are passing, submit the assignment.
Code
All of the code you need to write for this project should go in the src/js/app.jsx file. First we will define the HTML elements needed for the page. Place this HTML inside of the div element with the className attribute set to 'container' in src/js/app.jsx. Use the Bootstrap horizontal form layout to define the visible elements of the page: - An input element for the user to enter the mortgage loan balance in US dollars with a name attribute of 'balance' and type 'number'. - An input element for the user to enter the annual percentage rate of charge (APR) with a name attribute of 'rate', a type attribute of 'number' and a step attribute of 0.01 to allow for decimal rate percentages. - A select element for the user to select a loan term with the name attribute of 'term', populated with option elements that display the available terms, in this case, either '15' or '30'. The value attribute inside of each option element should represent the corresponding terms (15 or 30). - A button element with a name attribute of 'submit' for the user to calculate their monthly mortgage payment based on the above inputs. - A div element to display the mortgage payment with a name attribute of 'output'. You will need to add additional attributes to these HTML elements as we develop the Javascript portion of the project. (Note: Make sure you also give the element an id attribute of 'output'. Otherwise, your tests will not pass!)

Next, lets write some Javascript to implement the calculation logic for the project. All of this code should be located inside the curly braces of the logic block class App extends Component. Here we need to define 3 functions:

A constructor method to initialize the state of the app. Here you will need to add a property for each input field to the state object and set their initial values. Then, return to your HTML and add a value attribute to each editable input element in your HTML to bind these elements to their respective properties on the state object.
A function to update state values when an input changes, using event binding. Once this is in place, return to your HTML and add an onChange event to each of the input elements that calls this new method.
A calculate function to determine the mortgage payment and then set state to bind the result to the div with an id of 'output' as a string like this: $1945.09 is your payment. This function should accept 3 parameters: balance, rate, and term. Finally, return to your HTML and add an onClick event to this button that calls the calculate function while passing the state object as an argument.
Exit Criteria
Should include a number input for the loan balance
Should include a number input for the interest rate
Should include a select dropdown for the loan term (either 15 or 30)
Should include a button to trigger the calculation
Should pass all provided test cases.
Bonus
Add amortization schedule logic and display it in a table
Project Submission
To submit this project, upload it to Github, then please deploy this website using Now.

# navigate to the project
$ cd ~/projects/{project-name}

# run "now" to deploy the site
$ now
After running that command, you should see the following output:

> Deploying ~/projects/{project-name} under your@email.com
> Ready! https://{project-name}-skckceswsd.now.sh (copied to clipboard)
Submit your Now URL using the link at the bottom to navigate to the submission page, and do it again once more for your github repository URL on the following page. Once you submit both URLs for the project, you can move onto the next assignment. An instructor will evaluate your work at a later time, giving feedback if necessary.
